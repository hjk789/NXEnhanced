## How to use it

For Firefox, just click the "Get the Addon" link above, then click the "Add to Firefox" button and confirm.  

For Chrome (and other Chromium based browsers), just click the "Available in the Chrome Web Store" link above, then click the "Add to Chrome" button and confirm.

You also have the option of using the userscript version, but it works only in Chrome, in Firefox it works partially. Also, keep in mind that the userscript is discontinued. For more information and instructions, read [here](https://github.com/hjk789/NXEnhanced/tree/master/Userscript#how-to-use-it).

NX Enhanced was tested in Firefox and Chrome. It should work fine in pretty much any browser that accepts Firefox or Chrome extensions, although I didn't tested them.
